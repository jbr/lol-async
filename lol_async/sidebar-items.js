It takes a data `Source` that is [`AsyncRead`] and a [`Settings`] that describes the desired rewriting logic. It returns a !Send [`LolFuture`] future that drives the rewriter on the current thread and a [`LolReader`] that is Send and can be used anywhere an [`AsyncRead`] would be used.

LolReader is Send, allowing it to be used on a different thread from the paired [`LolFuture`]. Please note that reading from LolReader does not drive the LolHtml rewriter.
